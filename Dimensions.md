[ IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VIBE CAFE THE TERM DIMENSION REFERS TO DISTINCT PLANES OF REALITY. ]¬†
  
There are many, many dimensions within our known universe, some distinguished by numbers, some by words, and others by symbols.¬†

These planes of reality contain a variety of different things; some are not unlike our own, with galaxies, and planetary systems with everything that calls them home. Some can be very different and alien when compared to our own, some can be considered purely incomprehensible while some are seemingly empty, or Dead.¬†

Every dimension is home to a [[TITANS|TITAN]].
DIMENSIONAL Mass (DM) is a metric used to describe the amount of stuff in a DIMENSION, and due to the nature of DIMENSIONS, is very hard to measure and use. DM
  

‚ÄúDEAD‚Äù DIMENSIONS:

  
![[-1.png|250]]

Almost every dimension considered Dead are completely unnoteworthy, as they are thoroughly empty. An exception to this is the case of one known as¬† ‚Äú -1 ‚Äú.¬† -1 is comprised of nothing but an infinitely vast field of pale blue sand and a colorless sky.

What makes -1 special is its purpose, as it serves as a kind of purgatory. Its only real resident is a flying clownfish that is as large as a blue whale by the name of Bertholdt.

This is ‚ÄúThe Void‚Äù one would go to pay for their sins.

  
REGULAR DIMENSIONS:¬†

There are currently two dimensions that are important to the story; they are

[UNNAMED 1]

This dimension is extraordinarily similar to our own, being virtually the same with exception of a few events, places, and people. ////// also follows a similar timeline to our own, and every human comes from this dimension.

üåÄ / The Spiral ^bc7886

This dimension is home to many lively planetary systems, including [[NIBEKO]]. üåÄ is also notably home to the rogue planet [[URSURN]]

  

TRANSDIMENSIONAL TRAVEL:

Transdimensional travel; as its name implies, is the practice of crossing the metaphorical, spiritual, and physical barrier that separates dimensions. This practice is very difficult, but not impossible for most beings. Transdimensional travel can be abbreviated as TT.

The practice itself is rather complicated. There are several methods for TT

If the act of transdimensional travel is performed improperly (E.g., the process is rushed, It is interrupted moments before or after the crossing, the traveler crosses into the incorrect dimension, etc, etc) many physical or mental complications can occur. These complications are actually quite rare, though when they do happen, they are life-altering, and often life-threatening. ( Dr. Dolores Holmes is an exemplary case of both the mental and physical aspects of the phenomenon.)

(Fig. 2, Holmes after the onset of her TT complications)

TT does not always occur voluntarily, there have been many cases of involuntary transdimensional travel (ITT), and this phenomenon has some level of documentation in most dimensions, though in some dimensions (E.g., The Spiral ) ITT is more common than in others. ( Luc Lovell‚Äôs ‚Äòsitcheation is a textbook case of ITT.) ITT Is often very distressing for the traveler, especially once they understand that no, they are not dreaming. 

A subset of ITT variations is involuntary alternating transdimensional travel (IATT). IATT varies from ITT in that one that experiences IATT will involuntarily return to their originating dimension after a period of time (usually around a day, or from the time they arrive in their destinating dimension to the time they fall asleep.) 
IATT is fascinating because unlike ITT, it closely mimics more voluntary forms of TT, despite the traveler having no control over this. This similarity has caused some to speculate that that some sort of outside force causes IATT. This outside force it argued to be all sorts of things; Gods, spirits, government interference. In reality, it can anyone or anything with the ability to target someone and remotely cause them to travel across dimensions with consistency. In most situations, there would be no reason for this to be done, so cases of IATT are quite rare.

Another variation of ITT is postmortem involuntary transdimensional travel (PMITT (these names are getting ridiculous..)) PMITT varies from ITT in that PMITT occurs after one has died. The corpse of the traveler remains in their originating dimension, while their spirit crosses dimensions. Once the spirit crosses, it depends on both the dimension and person if they will take a corporeal form. If the spirit does take a corporeal form, it will often be different than their living form. These changes can be slight, for example, one may have scars reflecting how they died, the eye color may change, etc. These changes can also be major; the size or composition of the body may change, they may lose body parts reflecting how they died.
In some cases of PMITT, where the traveler's spirit does not technically take a corporeal form, rather "possessing" a robotic body, or an object. The traveler does not consciously choose whether they will take a corporeal form or not; additionally, the severity of the traveler's scars / changes seem to reflect their emotional state at the time of -or close to- their death, with people who are very distressed before their death seeming to have drastic changes, though this is not always the case.
