**Ursurn’s diameter is approximately 12,000 miles, Ursurn is part of no planetary system, making it a rogue planet, and thus receives no heat from a host star. Its heat is either manmade or geothermic, though Ursurn’s atmosphere retains the small amounts of heat that the planet generates.

  

 Ursurn has a relatively high amount of gravity, in comparison to Earth, and a very thick atmosphere that appears a semi transparent very dark purpl-ish blue. Because Ursurn is a rogue planet, it receives almost no external light or heat, making life very difficult for a variety of reasons

  

Being a rogue planet, Ursurn’s climate does not vary much and is extremely frigid, with the average temperature being -120 degrees Fahrenheit (-84 C.). The highest temperature recorded on the planet was -66 degrees, and the lowest was -233 degrees.

Because Ursurn does not orbit a star, it has no seasons, nor a day/night cycle. The sky is constantly dark, only broken up by distant stars and lights on the planet’s moons.

  

Ursurn has four moons, all of which are habitable, as they have been terraformed. The largest of which is named Heze, is 3,750~ miles in diameter, and the second, called Tabit, has a 2.400~ in diameter. The third - named Suhail- is 2,100~ miles in diameter, and the fourth, Izar, is 1,800~ miles in diameter. Ursurn’s moons have been colonized by several countries across the planet.

  

Ursurn is about 60% percent water, but surface water is always frozen due to the extraordinarily cold temperature. The planet does have a decent amount of subsurface oceans hidden beneath its thick layers of ice; and on most of the planet, the ice extends around two miles down.  Ursurn’s bodies of water are usually saltwater.

  

Ursurn’s flora is surprisingly abundant for a planet like it. Typically plants will require three things to survive; water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight. Ursurn lacks any form of sunlight; so for energy, because of the planet’s nutrient-rich soil,  some species of plants will draw large amounts of nutrients from the ground, while others are carnivorous and will catch and eat insects or even mammals. 

The planet hosts many tall,  dense forests,  consisting of both trees and more commonly, giant fungi colonies. Plants are typically dark blue or black but can be tinted with warmer shades too. There are hardly any plant species that shed their leaves, because it takes too much energy for most species.

  

Ursurn is a very mountainous planet that is home to a diverse landscape; like unfathomably gargantuan caverns, numerous meteor craters, fungi colonies stretching across hundreds of miles, desolate stretches of land that are nothing but thousands of miles of snow, ice and occasional ruins made of stone, partially buried by the harsh conditions of the snowy deserts.   The planet notably lacks any sandy deserts or beaches. Ursurn is around 8 billion years old**

Ursurn has few intelligent species native to it, those being [[BRUMAI]]
