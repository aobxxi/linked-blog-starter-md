BRUMA [plural: BRUMAI] are an intelligent bipedal species that look highly similar to humans, known for their resilience and strength.

  

PHYSICAL TRAITS: BRUMAI can have white or greyish skin that has a subtle blue tint, but their complexions tend to not vary all that much. Their hair is naturally white, black, or a shade of grey, they are covered in a thin, almost invisible layer of fur. Like RHENO, they usually have longer fur on their cheeks, as well as on their chests. Their eyes can vary in color but are commonly blue, yellow, or green. Both their irides and sclera can be pigmented. Hailing from [[URSURN]], BRUMAI can find it hard to see outside of dark conditions. On average, BRUMAI are about five inches taller than HUMANS, and their weight tends to fluctuate a lot, but they usually weigh anywhere from 150 - 330 lbs.

There are three (or more idfk) classes of BRUMAI, Felis, Kanis, and Nokaudum

  

FELIS: Felis BRUMAI are characterized by furred, pointed ears positioned near the top of the head, typically the same color as the hair. The pupils are vertical slits, and the sclera is usually colored.

On the center of their philtrum, they will have a cleft-like structure, Felis BRUMAI have long tails, almost always the same color as the ears. Their hair will also typically be more curly than other classes of BRUMAI.

KANIS: Like those of the Felis class, Kanis BRUMAI are characterized by furred ears near the top of their heads, however, their ears are often floppy, though it is not uncommon for them to be pointed, like Felis BRUMAI. Another similarity between these classes is their tails, the difference is that a Kanis BRUMA tail will usually be shorter and have denser fur than a Felis BRUMA tail. The canine teeth of a Kanis protrude more frequently when compared to other classes. Like The Felis class, Kanis BRUMAI also will have a cleft on their philtrum, as well as a slightly larger nose.

NOKAUDUM: BRUMA of the Nokaudum class are often perceived as more similar in appearance to HUMANS than other classes of BRUMAI. A Nokaudum BRUMAâ€™s ears are positioned at the sides of their head, have no fur, and look similar to RISU ears, though they are often shorter. Nokaudum BRUMAI do not have tails, nor are they normally born with the cleft structure seen in other classes.
