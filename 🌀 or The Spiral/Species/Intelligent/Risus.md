RISUS are intelligent humanoid cold-blooded creatures best known for their simplistic faces and extreme adaptability.

PHYSICAL TRAITS: RISUS have a large range of natural hair colors, the most common ones being grey, black, pink, or blue. Their skin tone can vary but is commonly paper white or pale yellow, with “odd” faces, gills on the sides of their necks and abdomens, long, pointed ears, and razor-like teeth. RISUS are typically shorter and more muscular than humans, they also have long durable nails, and arms slightly longer than a typical human’s. Adult RISUS typically weigh anywhere from 110 - 250 lbs and are usually 3’9 to 5’7 feet tall. Because of the shape of their jawbones, their mouths curve upwards at the corners, appearing like a human smile. Because of their limited facial expressiveness, their body language will almost always be more of a tell for their emotions than their expression.

RISUS are typically only able to grow scalp hair, though there have been cases where an individual is able to grow facial hair. More commonly though, I.e. 30% of the species, may not be able to grow hair at all. 

  

RISUS have orangish-yellow blood and protruding vertebrae. Some have a sort of sail on their back, and almost all have a semi-transparent third eyelid.

  

LIFE CYCLE: A RISU begins their life as a hard-shelled egg and they remain in this stage for about 80 SUMMBARIAN days. These eggs are pale blue in color, have dark brown speckles, and are slightly larger than chicken eggs. 

RISUS are [simultaneous hermaphrodites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_hermaphroditism), meaning that members of the species have male and female reproductive organs, who are unable to engage in [autogamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogamy) due to a lack of genetic variations.

A RISU typically lays 6-8 eggs in a brood, however, usually, only 1 or 2 make it to adulthood, as young RISUS tend to die of diseases within 10 months of their hatching.

RISUS typically live about 130 EARTH years.

  

While RISUS live on a variety of habitable planets, it is unknown what planet they originated on. They typically live on hot, sunny planets due to being cold-blooded, though they are mentioned here because they have a surprisingly large population on [[SUMMBAH]] for seemingly unknown reasons.

  

DIET: With very sharp teeth and digestive systems specialized to get more nutrients from meat, RISUS are meant to be carnivores, however, most of them have a diet that more closely resembles omnivores. Unfortunately, there is a disorder that causes them to be completely unable to digest plant matter relatively common within their species.

  

Monochromacy [total color blindness] is somewhat common within RISUS, however, their eyesight tends to be significantly better than humans, [due to their inability to smell] and they have excellent night vision.

  

MISC: There are two types of RISU: Terrestrial and Oceanic. Terrestrial RISUS are land-dwelling bipedal and intelligent creatures. Oceanic RISUS are sea-dwelling and slightly less intelligent than their land-dwelling counterparts. They have long tails, much more pronounced sails, and are typically 10 feet long. Other than that though, they aren’t too different from their terrestrial brothers.
