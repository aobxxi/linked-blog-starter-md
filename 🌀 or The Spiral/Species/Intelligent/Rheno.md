RHENO are an intelligent mammalian bipedal species, native to [[SUMMBAH]]. (kinda like furries, but not exactly, as they aren't an anthropomorphized version of any given species.(They kinda look like the blue guys from avatar. kinda.(THEYRE NOT BLUE)))

  

PHYSICAL TRAITS: The short, scruffy fur covering a RHENO’s body typically mirrors human hair colors(except ginger shades), but muted shades of maroon and purple are also possible. They also almost always have streaks of white and grey. While they can't grow head hair in the way HUMANS or [[BRUMAI]] can, the fur near the top of their heads is thicker to provide a little extra protection from [[SUMMBAH]]’s star.

The fur on their neck and cheeks is longer than the rest of their bodies. They have short, stout necks and round faces.

Their eyes are wide set, indicative of a prey species. They have excellent night vision, as they are native to [[SUMMBAH]], though their eyesight is inferior. 

RHENO are around the same height and typically have the same amount of muscular strength as HUMANS. RHENO have quite long arms, as the tips of their fingers reach their knees, as well as vestigial nubbed tails. RHENO are usually 170 - 330 pounds, making them typically heavier than HUMANS.

  

SEXUAL DIMORPHISM: 

  

LIFE CYCLE: RHENO are mammals, meaning they give live birth, and have mammary glands to feed newborn offspring. The gestation period of a RHENO is generally about 160 days ( 5.2 months, or 23 weeks.) which is not enough time for the fetus to fully develop, as her offspring are born a little smaller than a quarter, blind, deaf, and without fur.

Female RHENO are rather similar to marsupials, in a way, as she will have a pouch to carry and nurse her offspring. This is because like other marsupials, RHENO have a shorter gestation period than most other mammals, and require time to develop more in their mother’s pouch.
