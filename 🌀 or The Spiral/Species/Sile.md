Sile are a small group of species that can be both bipedal and quadrupedal, though they often choose to walk quadrupedally. Sile Are native to [[SUMMBAH]].


PHYSICAL TRAITS: Sile have thick, chitinous skin that is typically very dark. Sile are almost totally hairless aside from whiskers on the head. Sile have large, wide-set compound eyes, no sense of smell, no teeth; rather, a gizzard. They also have the ability to bioluminesce, with multiple locations on the upper body that can glow, though these locations can change based on the individual, these markings are often symmetrical. 

A Sile's arms will be quite long, enough to comfortably support walking quadrupedally; they are also positioned at the front of the body, instead of the sides. Sile have five-fingered hands, two of these fingers are thumbs. Sile have thin membranous wings that resemble a moth’s; these wings are usually yellow, white. red, or blue. Adult Sile range from 11 inches to 2 feet tall and 6.8 to 12.3 pounds. Sile have large, compound eyes and because their insectoid nature, Sile have no eyelids
