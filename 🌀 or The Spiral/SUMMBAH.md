SIZE AND DISTANCE: SUMMBAH is a rocky planet in the NIBEKO system, and is the seventh planet. SUMMBAH is around 4,000 miles in diameter [6437 KM approx.], making it one of the smallest planets in its planetary system. SUMMBAH is about 7 AU away from its star. The gravity on SUMMBAH is less than that of earth.

  

ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere of SUMMBAH is made up of several gasses not found on EARTH. The majority of the atmosphere is made up of Iadril, [in normal conditions] a transparent, odorless gas.[If unassisted, HUMANS would suffocate on SUMMBAH] SUMMBAH has a deep blue sky, even during midday.

  

MOONS: SUMMBAH has three moons: RIGEL, RALUE, and CIRINI 

RIGEL is the largest, followed by RALUE and then CIRINI. RIGEL is approx. 2000 miles in diameter, RALUE is approx. 1,250 miles, CIRINI is approx. 800 miles in diameter. All of these moons are quite close, so despite being smaller than average they appear large in the sky [whenever they are visible].

  

Both RIGEL and CIRINI are inhabited by all different kinds of people from around SUMMBAH, however, RALUE remains uninhabited because of toxic gasses. 

  

CLIMATE: Being a rather small planet, SUMMBAH’S climate does not have much variation. SUMMBAH is a cold, wet, and dark planet most of the time, as it is almost always overcast and raining in many regions. The average temperature of SUMMBAH is 42° F [~5° C] 

  

SEASONS: Because of its axial tilt, SUMMBAH has two easily distinguishable seasons: Eedhib and Vihyt. Eedhib is most similar to a combination of EARTH’s Autumn and Spring, just colder. Eedhib’s temperatures vary anywhere from ~5° F to ~40° F [~-15° C to ~4° C]. On SUMMBAH, trees hardly ever shed their leaves, and many species don’t shed them at all.

Vihyt is more similar to EARTH’S summer. During Vihyt, it is hotter and typically rains more. Vihyt’s temperatures typically range from ~30° F to ~70° F on the hottest days. 

  

BODIES OF WATER: On SUMMBAH all bodies of water are freshwater, oceans do not freeze because of currents and the chemical composition of water is different than on EARTH (and is therefore not water, but who cares), and thus the freezing point is lower and the boiling point is higher. SUMMBAH is 80% water. Coastal towns do not exist unless they are on fortified cliffs because of very frequent flooding.

  
  

FLORA: Flora on SUMMBAH is usually a deep shade of red, though there are many species that are blue, orange, or purple. Carnivorous plants are relatively common. There are species on SUMMBAH that blur the lines of flora and fauna.

  

AGE: SUMMBAH is a bit over 6 billion years old, with life having existed for about 4 billion years. SUMMBAH, as well as everything else in its dimension, was created by the Gods.

LANDMASSES: SUMMBAH has two continents, MOURIA and OLTON, Both continents are relatively close in size.

  

MISC: Going out during the day on SUMMBAH is dangerous for some biological species, [usually more intelligent species who evolved to be smarter and not to defend against the sun's powerful radiation] for the reason that the sun is much more powerful and much larger than earth's sun.

 SUMMBAH is in a different [[Dimensions |dimension]] than EARTH. 

SUMMBAH has a population of 12 billion, RIGEL is home to around 900 million people, and CIRINI to approximately 450 million people.
