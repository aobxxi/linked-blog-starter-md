GOVERNMENT: GRUUAD is a [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) that is 320 years old. 

  

LOCATION/GEOGRAPHY: GRUUAD resides in central MOURIA, just below [[SUMMBAH]]’s equator, and is strangely warm for a SUMMBARIAN nation. GRUUAD is primarily mountainous deserts and is filled with strange, artificial-looking rock formations.

GRUUAD is a landlocked nation, bordering MAWIA on the north, SISVORKORO on the south, CHETHERIN, RHIALIEN, and PHUOCK to the east.

  

CITIES: NENCH is the capital of GRUUAD, with a population of 11.4 million, it is the third most populous in GRUUAD, and the ninth most populous on SUMMBAH. GRUUAD has many small villages, but very few cities. The first most populous in the nation is DAMBON, with a population of 13.8 million, making it the fifth most populous on SUMMBAH. 

A rather notable city in the jurisdiction of GRUUAD [ although it is seldom within the country's borders ] is KOURIAN, a somewhat small city hosted entirely on an airship [ see below ] of the same name. The ship itself is a rigid airship with a gondola that is an incredible 11.5 miles long and 2 miles wide or 60720 ft long and 10560 ft wide. KOURIAN has a population of about 300,000~, of which about 1000 are staff of the ship, and around 70 are robots or androids. KOURIAN is self-sustaining, with a relatively stable economy and steady food sources. The ship will typically land every other night to let people enter or exit, engage in commerce, etc. KOURIAN frequently travels outside of GRUUAD; though it typically stays in MOURIA, it seldom visits OLTON.

  

CULTURE

  

GRUUAD has a very deep and complex culture, fueled by family traditions and cultures of surrounding nations.

  

SOCIAL NORMS: Some social norms regarding public behavior include: Avoiding eye contact, as it can be considered [outside of close or romantic relationships] a sign of disrespect or a threat, sitting right next to a stranger on, for example, a bus and making convoration is normal. Some others include: Arriving at a social gathering at least 10 minutes early, taking off your shoes when entering someone else’s home.

 Additionally, being very honest with others [telling others when you don’t agree with their opinions, telling others what you think of their work] speaking loudly, greeting others with a kiss on the forehead, expressing gratitude,  dressing very casually in most situations, eating with one's hands instead of utensils is normal, rejecting given food or drinks is considered rude.

  

LANGUAGE:

MISC: GRUUAD is SUMMBAH’s largest exporter of several things, one of which is [airships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship), which are a much more popular form of transport than on earth because the gas that is most commonly used for the ships is cheaper and more common than helium [gas that is currently most commonly used for airships on Earth] and no accidents at the scale or notoriety of the Hindenburg Disaster have happened on SUMMBAH. The aforementioned gas is thankfully not flammable.

  

(did you know the hindenburg had a smoking room? I mean its reasonable for the time period but the ship was inflated with HYDROGEN!!!! A NOTORIOUSLY FLAMMABLE GAS!!!!!! Its a miracle it didnt catch fire before it did!!)
