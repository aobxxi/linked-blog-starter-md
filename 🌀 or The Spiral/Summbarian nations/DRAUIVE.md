[Flag of DRAUIVE]

  

GOVERNMENT: DRAUIVE is an oppressive corporatocracy that has existed for  72 years. DRAUIVE is the most technologically advanced nation on [[SUMMBAH]]. DRAUIVE is controlled by Heidurra Technology Corp., aka HEIDURRA. HEIDURRA was established about 20 years after DRAUIVE was formed, so HEIDURRA overthrew the government 40 years back. Before HEIDURRA was in control, DRAUIVE was a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy) and was a surprisingly nice place to live [by SUMMBARIAN standards anyways], however today the quality of life is much worse.

  
RULERS: To date, DRAUIVE has only had two rulers; ??? and ELISHA MUST. Today, DRAUIVE would choose its future rulers via bloodline, for example; when ELISHA MUST is to die, he will have his eldest child see over HEIDURRA and therefore DRAUIVE. ELISHA himself is a very hateful person.


CITIES: DRAUIVE’s capital is ELTANIN, with a population of 16.5 million, it is the second most populous city on SUMMBAH, and the first most populous in DRAUIVE. DRAUIVE is comprised of a small amount of large, dense cities with the rest of the nation being rural. DRAUIVIAN cities are typically comprised of several regions, akin to districts.

  
CEDUUK: Since CEDUUK is where the main story takes place, it gets its own section. As stated below, CEDUUK is on KRAZ, an island off of the southwestern coast of DRAUIVE. CEDUUK has 10 districts, four of which are entirely underground, some more neglected by the local government than others; the cafe itself is in the fifth district. CEDUUK has a population of 11 million. 

 District Five is very overlooked by the government, making crime rampant there, going out alone isn’t a good idea. District 5 also doesn’t receive enough funding, making many buildings have a run-down appearance, in addition to the water damage because of nigh constant storms. On a darker note; suicide rates are the highest in the nation in CEDUUK, District 5, and substance abuse rates are the second highest in the nation.

 Half of districts 9 and 10 are completely blocked off from public access for seemingly unknown reasons, though something strange is going on there.

CEDUUK is based around the hexagon; where a city might have city blocks, CEDUUK’s “blocks” are hexagonal.  These “blocks” are called cells; and because of the shape of these cells, CEDUUK has grown into a honeycomb shape. 


Additionally, CEDUUK is a completely carless city, and was designed with pedestrian mobility in mind. Of course, being geographically a huge city; CEDUUK has a sprawling subway system

LANDSCAPES: The inhabited areas of DRAUIVE are mostly only the cities because the most dangerous fauna on the continent tends to be in DRAUIVE. So if you were to live there you would hardly see the natural landscape, but it mostly consists of sparse forests and plains.

  

ISLANDS: There is only one island within DRAUIVE’s borders, KRAZ [aka the Northern island] KRAZ contains the city of CEDUUK, as stated above.

  

CULTURE

  

Being such a young nation, DRAUIVE hardly has any culture original to itself and is a combination of ideals and fragments from other cultures across SUMMBAH, and almost all of DRAUIVE’s culture is actually just the now dissolved LATANIA’s culture.

  

MORALITY: Many DRAUIVIAN citizens have an “every man for himself” mentality and are very apathetic, and in general could be considered less moral than most earthlings

   Violence is a common and somewhat mundane occurrence 

  

LANGUAGE: The primary language of DRAUIVE comes from a nation dissolved before DRAUIVE gained independence and therefore has been around longer than DRAUIVE itself has. DRAUIVE’s official language is LATANIAN, after the now-dissolved LATANIA.

SOCIAL CLASS:

  

RELIGION:

  

TECHNOLOGY: Being controlled by HEIDURRA, DRAUIVE is very focused on developing new tech and improving old tech; after all, that’s what HEIDURRA specializes in. 

One of their most important inventions is [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality). in DRAUIVE, AR is not only much more advanced than on EARTH, but it also takes on a much more important role than on EARTH. It is used for a variety of things, from assistance in the medical field to education to communication. In addition, almost every android made by HEIDURRA has AR built-in. Of course, AR also comes with its security concerns. 

  

AR devices made by HEIDURRA usually take the form of visors, glasses, or if it's more high-end helmets.

HEIDURRA helmets have more features than their other AR devices; for example some models also function as VR systems, and many have voice changers pre installed. Though some models don’t actually provide sufficient protection to actually function as a “helmet” [typically those that have VR capabilities] there are some that do.

HEIDURRA: The name “HEIDURRA” refers to two companies, Heidurra Holdings Co., and Heidurra Technology Corp. Heidurra Holdings Co. is a conglomerate holding company with around 200 subsidiaries, with Heidurra Technology Corp. being their oldest. If someone uses the name HEIDURRA, they are typically referring to Heidurra Technology Corp. unless stated otherwise. 

  

HEIDURRA TECHNOLOGY CORP.: Heidurra Technology Corp. is Heidurra Holdings co.’s largest subsidiary and one of the most important, as this corporation not only brings in a good portion of HEIDURRA’s revenue, but this is also the subsidiary that controls DRAUIVE’s government. 

 In addition, HEIDURRA is the largest manufacturer of androids on SUMMBAH, with nearly 400 million units sold. HEIDURRA typically only produces androids made for consumer use. Unfortunately, HEIDURRA androids go “Rogue” far more often than their competitors, deviating from instructions and orders given by their owners, sometimes resulting in those owners getting seriously injured or, in rare cases, killed. [BUT MUH THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS!!!!! THEY CAAAAAANT DO THAT!!!!!!!!]

  

SILEHOFF: The Silehoff Co. is the second largest manufacturer of robots on SUMMBAH. The main reason SILEHOFF hasn't been integrated into HEIDURRA is the difference between their products, standards, and . While HEIDURRA’s image is based on improving on what is already there, SILEHOFF’s image is based on making something entirely new.     

 SILEHOFF’s robots tend to take on a less humanoid form than HEIDURRA’s. They also only specialize in producing robots, while HEIDURRA makes many kinds of tech as well as androids. SILEHOFF’s robots are also generally made for commercial use, while HEIDURRA almost exclusively makes consumer androids. Neither company is superior to the other, as both have advantages and disadvantages. For example; SILEHOFF’s robots tend to look less aesthetically pleasing [not necessarily uncanny] to people, while HEIDURRA’s have a higher tendency to deviate from their original purpose and to go Rogue. 

SILEHOFF was established in 396

HISTORY

In the year 358, Eqas Period [E.P.], the LATANIAN REPUBLIC was dissolved into two states, OURNO and MIJISO. 7 years after the establishment of OURNO, in 369 a new political party emerged, the democratic party, formally called the Democratic Party of Ourno [DPO]. DPO stated that OURNO’s government was horribly authoritarian, and did not represent the will of the people; the party promised to fix those perceived problems;  and believed that a democracy was the best way to operate the young nation and fix its problems.

In 370, late in Kieng, OURNO passed 

 On Asuff 14th, 384 the Ourniese Civil War began, with the battle of
