[Flag of SYMIA]

GOVERNMENT: SYMIA is an elitist oligarchic theocracy that has existed for about 1200~ years.

SYMIA is often considered the religious capital of [[SUMMBAH]]

Being a theocracy, the Gods have ultimate power over SYMIA; however, They often choose not to intervene directly, habitually choosing to control the government through the Areiaru [see below]. 

  

CITIES:  SYMIA is home to several major cities, its capital being Alnair. With a population of 7.3 million, it's the largest city in SYMIA and the 14th largest on SUMMBAH.

  

POPULATION:

  

LANDSCAPES: SYMIA’s landscapes are quite unique, and are unlike most other nations in OLTON. SYMIA is teeming with rivers and dense forests, and the flora overgrows abundantly. There are several species of flora and fauna native to SYMIA, which seem to not be able to survive, let alone thrive on any other part of SUMMAH, or any other planet. There is speculation that this is because of a special "divine" energy that flows through SYMIA.

  

CULTURE: Being a theocracy, religion is a very important part of life in SYMIA

  

CASTE SYSTEM: SYMIA has an ancient caste system, [known as Dyuaret] having existed long before the establishment of SYMIA as a nation. Unfortunately, discrimination against lower castes is very commonplace

The SYMIAN caste system has existed, in different iterations, for well over 2000 years. A SYMIAN’s caste is determined at birth, although there are certain circumstances where one may be able to ascend or descend the Dyuaret.

  

The Dyuaret is a five-fold system consisting of, ranked from lowest to highest, the Ugawaru, the Musharu, the Innearu, the Tenjiaru, and finally, the revered Areiaru. 

There are also some beneath The Dyuaret,  those who are colloquially called “Outcaste”.

The system is frequently criticized for being regressive, oppressive, and unjust. Despite the widespread criticism, it continues to be an important part of SYMIA’s culture, laws, and SYMIAN people’s identities.

  

OUTCASTE: The Outcaste is unlike the rest of the levels of the Dyuaret in several ways; for example, they are completely unrecognized, and therefore unprotected, by the SYMIAN government. 

Those who fall under the label of Outcaste are generally murderers, those who reject ______,

the children of other Outcastes, and most notably false prophets.

  

UGAWARU: The Ugawaru is the lowest recognized rank of the Dyuaret. People of this caste are typically unskilled workers, servants of higher ranking levels of the Dyuaret, and manual laborers
